# SaaS Company Landing Page

This markdown content is from a beginner-friendly [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/HXYZxVbWkjc?si=KVSD466I0hH3Be0q) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) on creating a professional website using HTML and CSS. The project is part of the [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and does not rely on any frameworks or libraries. It includes a hamburger menu and a FAQ accordion implemented with JavaScript. Please refer to the description for the website link.
